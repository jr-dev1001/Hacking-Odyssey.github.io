## Welcome Back

Hola gente..!

> Disclaimer: This blog only discusses my POV on ISC2 CC.

### Introduction

This post provides an overview of Certified in Cybersecurity (CC), offered by ISC2, a non-profit organization specializing in training and certifications for cybersecurity professionals. I recently passed the test, which is super exciting since it‚Äôs my first official cert to add to my collection. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the course content and what the test looks like.

The CC test is divided into five major domains:

1. Security Principles  
2. Business Continuity Plan, Disaster Recovery, and Incident Response  
3. Access Control Concepts  
4. Network Security  
5. Security Operations Center (SOC)

### Mistakes I Made During Preparation

- **Solely Following Official Docs:** While the official documentation is excellent for learning, it‚Äôs insufficient for test preparation.
- **Overconfidence:** Scoring 90+ in every domain and pre/post-course tests made me overly confident.
- **Diving Too Deep:** I spent too much time on concepts I found interesting but weren‚Äôt necessary for the test. (You can do if you have time)
- **Late Dump Practice:** I started solving dumps only four days before the test, which was a mistake.

### Resources

1. **ISC2 CC Self-Paced Course:**
   - Easy to understand, with podcasts, articles, and videos.
   - Test questions are different from the course material, so additional preparation is necessary.

2. **LinkedIn Learning: ISC2 CC by Mike Chapple:**
   - A highly recommended resource by many who‚Äôve passed the test.

3. **Prabh Nair‚Äôs [YouTube Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0hT6hgexlYw-k6GxQf_DIAPdc96T2MP-&si=Z2I3dQLFbPoAWELZ):**
   - My favorite resource! His coffee shots and explanations help you think like how you need to read the problem.

4. **GitHub Repo by [Ayemun Hossain](https://github.com/AyemunHossain/ISC2-CC-Dump-Questions-Study-Material):**

### Final Thoughts

Achieving the ISC2 CC certification was a rewarding experience and a great way to solidify my foundational cybersecurity knowledge. While the certification covers the basics, it serves as a stepping stone for exploring more advanced areas of cybersecurity. If you‚Äôre planning to take the test, start early, use diverse resources, and practice as much as possible. 

Good luck..!
